# Portfolio-for-Final
So the first project I chose to improve upon was my twitter bot from the beginning of the year. My twitter bot actually didn't meet the standard for the completion of the assignment. What I mean by that, is that when I made it it didn't create 100,000 different things that it could say. So I made a new one and fixed that. For my new Bot I made a bot that will tweet out different sounds that lightsabers make. The account is called Lightsaber Noises and here is the link:

For my second project I chose to go back to our glitch art. I decided to try a new method of making glitch art with a text editor. I did this by downloading the text editor Notepad ++ and dragging and dropping bmp files into it. I had to change the files I used from jpeg files to bmp files because NOtepad would not have recognized jpeg files. For my theme this time I decided on space because I'm a big fan of space and Sci Fi stuff.
The gallery of my art is available here:

The third Project I chose to revise was my clock. I actually really like my clock but I wanted to make it a little better. i thought the best way to do this was to add an interesting background to it. I did this by added three images, two of night and one of day to be behind my clock. This gives a sense of time to the clock in addition to the clock just telling time. The code to the clock it linked here:

For my fourth project I decided to make a new novel. To do this I took my old code for my previous novel and added a few lines to add varatiion in the length of the sentences the novel generated. I did this to make the novel feel more real and alive as real books have lots of sentence length. The rest I left the same. I also changed the input this time around. Instead of the script to Troll 2 I took the opening chapter of Dracula and input that instead. The result I uploaded here titled my New Novel. It is over 80,000 words long. The input that I used to get that I also uploaded here under DraculaChapter1. The code to generate the novel was also uploaded.
