# Portfolio-for-Final
So the first project I chose to improve upon was my twitter bot from the beginning of the year. My twitter bot actually didn't meet the standard for the completion of the assignment. What I mean by that, is that when I made it it didn't create 100,000 different things that it could say. So I made a new one and fixed that. For my new Bot I made a bot that will tweet out different sounds that lightsabers make. The account is called Lightsaber Noises and here is the link:
