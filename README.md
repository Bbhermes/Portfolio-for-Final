# Portfolio-for-Final
So the first project I chose to improve upon was my twitter bot from the beginning of the year. My twitter bot actually didn't meet the standard for the completion of the assignment. What I mean by that, is that when I made it it didn't create 100,000 different things that it could say. So I made a new one and fixed that. For my new Bot I made a bot that will tweet out different sounds that lightsabers make. The account is called Lightsaber Noises and here is the link:

For my second project I chose to go back to our glitch art. I decided to try a new method of making glitch art with a text editor. I did this by downloading the text editor Notepad ++ and dragging and dropping bmp files into it. I had to change the files I used from jpeg files to bmp files because NOtepad would not have recognized jpeg files. For my theme this time I decided on space because I'm a big fan of space and Sci Fi stuff.
The Art is on this page, labled one, two, three, four and five.
A galllery of it is also available on my pintrest page here:
